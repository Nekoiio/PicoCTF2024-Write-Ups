# PicoCTF24-Santa-Write-ups
This is where we will store scripts and methods to complete the challenges.

Only create writeups for ctf with more than 100 points, or ones you felt were very involved.

## Structure
Folders should be laid out the following way.

/{Main Category}/{Challenge Name}/{Content}

Don't forget to include a concise README.md for every challenge explaning your methodology.
