Sigh... This was annoying.

Steps:
1. Reverse the encoder by indexing the second array and applying the opposite steps of the encoder.
    a. Don't make the mistake of starting on the end of the array like me, b/c the encoding of each letter depends on the index of the one before it.
2. You will get out a python script. Feed that script to itself and you will get the password (pwd = "adlibs").
    a. DON'T TRY TO FORMAT THE SCRIPT BEFORE FEEDING IT INTO ITSELF, YOUR EDITOR MIGHT DO THIS ON SAVE BY DEFAULT.
    ^do not experience my pain.
