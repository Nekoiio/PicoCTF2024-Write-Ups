# Heap 1 Challenge

## Overview
In the "heap 1" challenge, the goal is to exploit a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability to change the value of a target buffer and print the flag.

## Steps to Complete the Challenge

1. **Analyze the Source Code:** 
   - Looked through source to see both safe var and user input were being allocated to dynamic mem.
   - Identified that to get the flag, it is necessary to change the second buffer "bico" to "pico".

2. **Calculate the Buffer Overflow:**
   - Used the binary's own utilities to calculate the difference that would lead to overflow into the target buffer within heap.

3. **Exploit the Vulnerability:**
   - Overwrote "bico" with "pico" to manipulate the target buffer.
   - Printed the flag by triggering the correct condition.

4. **Completion:**
   - Successfully completed the challenge by exploiting the heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability.
