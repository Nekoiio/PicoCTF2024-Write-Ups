# Format String 1 - Solving Guide

## Overview
The Format String 1 challenge is a basic format string vulnerability based on x64 architecture. The goal is to exploit the vulnerability to leak memory contents and find the flag.

## Solution Steps

1. **Identify Vulnerability**: Determine that the program is vulnerable to a format string attack, where user input is used as a format string in a `printf` or `sprintf` function without proper validation.

2. **Leak Addresses**: Use the `%lx` format specifier instead of `%x` to print out the complete addresses. Since addresses in x64 are 8 bytes long, `%lx` will print the addresses correctly in little-endian format.

3. **Decode Addresses**: Use a tool like CyberChef to convert the leaked memory addresses from hex to ASCII. Look for any data that resembles the flag format (`picoCTF{...}`).

4. **Reverse Byte Order**: Since the data is in little-endian format, reverse the bytes in each address to get the correct ASCII characters.(Its gonna be little endian every 8 bytes bcs x64)

5. **Find the Flag**: Once you have all the parts of the flag, concatenate them to get the complete flag.
